/*
 * Bounded per-connection queue for realtime delivery.
 *
 * Provides a fair, memory-bounded buffer for a single consumer connection. When the
 * consumer cannot keep up, the queue enforces a drop/disconnect policy and exposes a
 * resumable recovery path (catch-up handoff) without logging protected payloads.
 *
 * Design goals:
 *   - Memory / queue growth is bounded by a configured max item count and byte cap.
 *   - One slow client cannot exhaust shared worker memory.
 *   - Dropped clients receive a resumable recovery path (cursor / sequence handov).
 *   - Other clients remain unaffected (isolated per-connection state).
 *   - No protected payload is logged during overflow (byte counts and metadata only).
