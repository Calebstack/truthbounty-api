/**
 * Scraping detector (PREWAVE-BE-086, #681).
 *
 * Scraping looks like *breadth without identity*: an anonymous subject walking
 * a large number of distinct route groups at a read velocity far above a human
 * browsing session. Volume and breadth are reported as **separate dimensions**
 * so that a single loud axis cannot clear the corroboration bar on its own —
 * which is what keeps a bursty but legitimate client (a dashboard polling one
 * route, a crawler the operator opted into) out of the action path.
