/**
 * Credential stuffing detector (PREWAVE-BE-086, #681).
 *
 * Two shapes, each a distinct dimension:
 *
 *  - `credential_spread` — one network subject trying many *different*
 *    credentials. The classic spray.
 *  - `subject_spread` — one credential fingerprint presented from many
 *    *different* subjects. This is invisible to per-subject limits, which is
 *    exactly why it matters, and why it is read from the shared store rather
 *    than the local window.
 *
 * Only salted credential fingerprints ever reach this detector. A single
 * credential failing many times is a password problem, not credential
 * stuffing, so success on the same subject suppresses the spray signal rather
 * than merely lowering it.
