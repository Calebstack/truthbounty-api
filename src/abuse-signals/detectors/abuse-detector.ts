/**
 * Detector contract (PREWAVE-BE-086, #681).
 *
 * A detector is a **pure function of the aggregate window**: it reads counters
 * and emits findings, and it never issues, applies or mutates an action. That
 * separation is what lets the same detector run on any replica, be replayed
 * against a stored window in a test, and be unit-tested without a store, a
 * clock or a network.
 *
 * Detectors are deliberately coarse and volume-based. Anything that needed a
 * content judgement (evidence validity, claim truth, dispute merit) belongs in
 * moderation, not here: this module sees counts, never protocol meaning.
