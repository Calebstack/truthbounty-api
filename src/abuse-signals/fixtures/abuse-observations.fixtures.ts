/**
 * False-positive fixtures for abuse detection (PREWAVE-BE-086, #681).
 *
 * Every fixture here is **benign traffic that a naive threshold trips**. They
 * exist so the test suite can prove the corroboration rule does its job: a
 * single loud axis produces a finding, never an action.
 *
 * The cases are drawn from shapes that really occur in production:
 *  - a polling dashboard hammering one read route,
 *  - a bulk importer submitting many *distinct* payloads,
 *  - a user who fat-fingers several passwords before succeeding,
 *  - a websocket client reconnecting noisily,
 *  - a user resubmitting a support form because the first attempt looked lost,
 *  - an integrator re-registering endpoints during a migration.
 *
 * All timestamps share a base so a whole fixture lands in one window.
