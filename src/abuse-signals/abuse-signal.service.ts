/**
 * Abuse signal evaluation and bounded enforcement (PREWAVE-BE-086, #681).
 *
 * **What this service can do:** observe traffic, decide whether a subject is
 * abusing a delivery surface, issue a bounded action with a mandatory expiry,
 * and answer whether an action is currently in force.
 *
 * **What it deliberately cannot do:** touch protocol state. It holds no
 * repository for claims, verification, disputes, rewards, treasury or
 * governance, injects no chain client and no signer, and the only thing it
 * writes is an abuse decision and a bounded action. Finalized canonical
 * contract events remain the authority for anything that matters on-chain.
 *
 * **Fail-closed rules**, all of which produce an `INDETERMINATE` decision
 * rather than a guess:
 *  - no verified subject          -> `UNATTRIBUTED`
 *  - missing/ambiguous binding    -> `RELEASE_BINDING_INVALID`
 *  - store read/write failure     -> `STORE_UNAVAILABLE`
 *
 * **Bound rules:** every action carries an `expiresAt` strictly after its
 * `startedAt`, capped by {@link AbusePolicyConfig.maxActionDurationMs} and by a
 * hard 24h ceiling that configuration cannot raise. Escalation is monotonic per
 * window and capped, so repeated abuse cannot grow an action without limit, and
 * an open appeal pins the escalation level instead of granting immunity.
