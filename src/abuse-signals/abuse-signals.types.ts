/**
 * PREWAVE-BE-086 (issue #681): abuse signal contract.
 *
 * These types are the wire contract for abuse detection and enforcement. The
 * boundary is deliberately narrow:
 *
 *  - Abuse signals are **advisory to the API's own delivery surface only**.
 *    Nothing here can create, mutate, settle, resolve, reward or otherwise
 *    change protocol truth. Claims, verification, disputes, rewards, treasury
 *    and governance remain reproducible from finalized canonical contract
 *    events, and the deployed contracts remain authoritative.
 *  - Every automated action is **bounded and time-limited**: an action without
 *    a valid, future `expiresAt` is never issued and never enforced.
 *  - Every decision carries a **versioned reason code** plus the model and
 *    config versions that produced it, so a historical decision is never
 *    re-interpreted after thresholds change.
 *  - Heuristics, thresholds, aggregates and subject keys are **internal**. The
 *    public surface exposes only the canonical {@link PublicErrorCode} and a
 *    `Retry-After` bound.
 *
 * Precedents mirrored here: `src/operations/operations.types.ts` (versioned
 * reason codes + bounded authority), `src/indexer/finalized-cursor` (release
 * binding + fail-closed provenance) and
 * `src/v2/events/entities/event-quarantine.entity.ts` (enum mirrored by a
 * database CHECK constraint).
