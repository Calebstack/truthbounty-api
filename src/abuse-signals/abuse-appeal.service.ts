/**
 * Appeal workflow for abuse actions (PREWAVE-BE-086, #681).
 *
 * Every automated action is appealable, and the appeal path is deliberately
 * bounded in both directions:
 *
 *  - **Bounded for the appellant.** At most {@link AbuseAppealPolicy.maxOpenAppealsPerSubject}
 *    open appeals per subject, each with a review deadline. Filing appeals in a
 *    loop cannot manufacture a review queue.
 *  - **Bounded for the accused.** Filing an appeal does **not** lift the
 *    action. It pins the escalation level, so the next decision can renew the
 *    existing bound but can never grow it. Immunity-by-appeal would be an abuse
 *    channel; blunting escalation is not.
 *  - **Bounded by time.** If nobody reviews it, the appeal expires at its SLA
 *    and the pin is released. Nothing waits on a human forever.
 *
 * Only an authenticated administrator may decide an appeal. There is no
 * self-service lift and no path from this module to protocol state.
