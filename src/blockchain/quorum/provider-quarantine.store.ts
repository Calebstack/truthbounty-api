/**
 * ProviderQuarantineStore — V2-BE-051
 *
 * In-memory quarantine state machine, per replica:
 *
 *   TRUSTED  ──(divergence observed)──►  QUARANTINED
 *   QUARANTINED ──(quarantineMs elapsed)──►  RECOVERING
 *   RECOVERING ──(freshAgreements ≥ required)──►  TRUSTED
 *   RECOVERING ──(divergence observed)──►  QUARANTINED (fresh reset)
 *
 * Two invariants drive the whole design:
 *
 *   1. `isQuarantined()` returns true from the moment a divergence is
 *      recorded **until** the provider is fully released — not merely
 *      until quarantineMs elapses. Time alone never trusts a provider;
 *      recovery also requires fresh agreement.
 *
 *   2. `recordAgreement()` only counts while the quarantine window has
 *      elapsed. This is what "fresh" means: agreements observed during
 *      the window itself do not accrue.
