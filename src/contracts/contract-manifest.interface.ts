/**
 * Typed interface for the canonical contract address manifest.
 *
 * The manifest is the authoritative, versioned record of every deployed
 * Optimism/EVM contract the indexer is allowed to observe. It is loaded at
 * startup from a checked-in JSON file (never hand-maintained at runtime) and
 * validated before the indexer accepts a single block.
 *
 * Design invariants
 * -----------------
 * - Fail closed: any schema violation, checksum mismatch, zero/dummy address,
 *   or missing field throws hard at startup; the app never runs with an
 *   unvalidated manifest.
 * - Immutable at runtime: the manifest is loaded once and never mutated;
 *   callers receive a deep-frozen copy.
 * - No alternate-chain paths: chainId must be an Optimism value (10 or
 *   11155420); other values are rejected.
 * - No backend-authoritative state: the manifest only tracks *where* to
 *   listen; it never carries settlement, reward, treasury, claim, or dispute
 *   state.
 * - Freshness guard: the manifest's publishedAt must not exceed
 *   MANIFEST_MAX_AGE_DAYS (default 90) days ago; stale manifests are
 *   rejected to prevent operators from deploying with outdated contract
 *   registrations.
